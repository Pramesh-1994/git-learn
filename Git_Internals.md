# Understanding Git Objects

Git uses three main types of objects to store and manage data: blobs, trees, and commits. These objects form the backbone of Git's version control system.

## 1. Blob

A blob (Binary Large Object) is a simple object that stores the content of a file. It represents the contents of a file at a specific point in time.

### Example

To create a blob object for a file:
```bash
echo "Hello, Git!" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```

## 2. Tree

A tree object represents a directory. It contains references to blobs (file content) and other trees (subdirectories).

### Example

To create a tree object for a directory:
```bash
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 <blob_hash> <file_name>
git write-tree
```

## 3. Commit

A commit object contains metadata about a particular set of changes. It points to a tree object that represents the state of the project at that commit. Commits also have parent pointers, forming a history of changes.

### Example

To create a commit object:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Relationship Among Objects

- **Blob to Tree**: Blobs store the content of files. Trees reference blobs for file content.
  
- **Tree to Tree**: Trees reference other trees for subdirectories.
  
- **Tree to Commit**: Commits reference a tree object representing the project state at that commit.

- **Commit to Commit**: Commits form a chain with parent pointers, creating a history of changes.

## Viewing and Inspecting Objects

### View Blob Content
```bash
git cat-file -p <blob_hash>
```

### View Tree Content
```bash
git cat-file -p <tree_hash>
```

### View Commit Information
```bash
git cat-file -p <commit_hash>
```

### View Object Type
```bash
git cat-file -t <object_hash>
```

### View Object Hash for a File
```bash
git hash-object <file_path>
```

### Explore Git Object Database
```bash
ls .git/objects
```
